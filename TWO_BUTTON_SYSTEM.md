1. **Asks why** you're hesitating (optional)
2. **AI analyzes** what might be wrong
3. **AI improves** the email

### **When to Use:**

- 🤔 Subject line is boring
- 🤔 You want it to be better but don't know how

### **What Happens:**

(User can provide feedback OR leave blank for auto-analysis)
    ↓

    ↓

### **Example Flow 1: With Feedback**
```
You: *clicks "🤔 AI Fix & Resend"*

Popup: 🤔 AI FIX & RESEND

I'll analyze this email and make it better!

Optional: Tell me what's bothering you?

You: "Not enthusiastic enough"

System: ⏳ AI Analyzing...

*GPT-5 analyzes and improves*

Popup: ✨ AI IMPROVED YOUR EMAIL!

📊 Analysis: The email was too formal and lacked enthusiasm 
for the opportunity. Added excitement about Google's tech 
stack and highlighted passion for DevOps.

🔄 What Changed:
  • Subject line now mentions specific role excitement
  • Opening paragraph shows genuine interest
  • Added enthusiasm about company's technology
  • Highlighted relevant AWS/GCP experience
  • Closing is warmer and more personable

📧 NEW Subject: Excited to Apply for Senior DevOps Engineer at Google!

Would you like to review before sending?

You: *clicks "Yes, review first"*

*Preview modal opens with new improved email*

You: *reads it, looks great!*

You: *clicks "✅ Send"*

```

### **Example Flow 2: Automatic Analysis**
```
You: *clicks "🤔 AI Fix & Resend"*

Popup: 🤔 AI FIX & RESEND

I'll analyze this email and make it better!

Optional: Tell me what's bothering you?

You: *leaves blank and clicks OK*

System: ⏳ AI Analyzing...

*GPT-5 automatically detects issues*

Popup: ✨ AI IMPROVED YOUR EMAIL!

📊 Analysis: The email was too generic and didn't highlight 
your cloud expertise enough. The JD specifically mentions 
AWS/Kubernetes, so I emphasized those skills and tailored 
the content to match Google's infrastructure focus.

🔄 What Changed:
  • Subject mentions specific AWS/Kubernetes expertise
  • Opening tailored to Google's cloud infrastructure
  • Added specific technical achievements
  • Mentioned relevant open-source contributions
  • Aligned experience with job requirements

📧 NEW Subject: AWS & Kubernetes Expert Applying for DevOps Role

Would you like to review before sending?

You: *clicks "No, send now!"*

*Email sent immediately with improvements*

System: ✅ Email sent successfully!
```

**Three JavaScript functions:**

1. **`sendNowOneClick(id)`**
   - Fetches submission
   - Shows confirmation with details
   - Calls `/approval/api/send-now/:id`
   - Updates UI on success

2. **`aiFixAndResend(id)`**
   - Shows feedback prompt
   - Sends feedback to `/approval/api/ai-fix-resend/:id`
   - Displays AI analysis and changes
   - Offers review or immediate send

3. **Button HTML:**
   ```html
   <button class="btn btn-send-now" onclick="sendNowOneClick('id')">
       ✅ Send Now
   </button>
   <button class="btn btn-ai-fix" onclick="aiFixAndResend('id')">
       🤔 AI Fix & Resend
   </button>
   ```

### **Backend API Endpoints:**

1. **POST `/approval/api/send-now/:id`**
   ```typescript
   // Auto-sends email with resume attached
   // No editing, just send!
   ```

2. **POST `/approval/api/ai-fix-resend/:id`**
   ```typescript
   // Body: { userFeedback: string }
   // Returns: { 
   //   analysis, 
   //   changes[], 
   //   newSubject, 
   //   newBody 
   // }
   ```

### **GPT-5 Integration:**

**For AI Fix & Resend:**
```typescript
const prompt = `
Current Email:
Subject: ${currentSubject}
Body: ${currentBody}

Job: ${role} at ${company}

User Feedback: ${userFeedback || 'Automatic analysis'}

Task: Analyze what's wrong and improve it.

Return JSON:
{
  "analysis": "Brief explanation of issues",
  "changes": ["Change 1", "Change 2", ...],
  "newSubject": "Improved subject",
  "newBody": "Improved body"
}
`;

const result = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-5',
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: 'You are an email improvement expert' },
    { role: 'user', content: prompt }
  ],
  temperature: 0.7,
  max_completion_tokens: 2000
