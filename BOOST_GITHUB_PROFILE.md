### 4. Create Activity Through Commits

**Over the next 7 days, make small improvements:**

**Day 1 (Today):**
```bash
cd /Users/nihalveeramalla/projects/agentkit
echo "## 🔄 Recent Updates\n\n- Enhanced email classification to 95% accuracy" >> CHANGELOG.md
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs: Add changelog for recent improvements"
git push
```

**Day 2:**
```bash
# Add a .gitignore improvement
echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "chore: Improve gitignore"
git push
```

**Day 3:**
```bash
# Add issue template
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
# Create bug report template
git add .github/
git commit -m "feat: Add issue templates"
git push
```

**Day 4-7:** Make small documentation updates, add comments, refactor code slightly

**Result:** Activity graph fills up, streak counter increases!
