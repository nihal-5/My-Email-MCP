# How to Get 100% FREE AI API Keys (2025 Update)

## 🎯 Best FREE AI Options (No Credit Card Required!)

### ⚠️ What Happened to Gemini?
Your Gemini API key hit the **daily quota limit** (0 tokens remaining). Google's free tier has strict limits that reset daily. We're switching to better free alternatives!

## ✅ Option 1: Hugging Face (RECOMMENDED - 100% FREE!)

**Why Hugging Face?**
- ✅ Completely FREE forever
- ✅ NO credit card required
- ✅ NO quota limits
- ✅ Access to Mistral 8x7B, Llama 3, Phi-3
- ✅ Takes 2 minutes to setup

**How to get your FREE API key:**

1. **Sign up:** https://huggingface.co/join
2. **Get token:** https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
3. Click "New token" → Name it "Resume Bot" → Select "Read" → Generate
4. Copy the token (starts with `hf_...`)
5. **Add to .env:**
   ```bash
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_token_here
   ```

**That's it! Uses Mixtral-8x7B - powerful and FREE!**

## 🚀 Option 2: Groq (ALTERNATIVE - Also 100% FREE!)

**Why Groq?**
- ✅ Completely FREE
- ✅ Super FAST (fastest inference in the market)
- ✅ Llama 3.1 70B access
- ✅ 14,400 requests/day (more than enough!)

**How to get your FREE API key:**

1. **Sign up:** https://console.groq.com/
2. **Get key:** https://console.groq.com/keys
3. Click "Create API Key" → Name it → Copy key (starts with `gsk_...`)
4. **Add to .env:**
   ```bash
   GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here
   ```

**Done! Llama 3.1 70B is blazing fast and FREE!**

## 💡 Best Strategy: Use BOTH! 🎉

The system automatically tries multiple providers:
1. **Hugging Face first** (unlimited, most reliable)
2. **Groq second** (if HF fails, super fast)
3. **OpenAI third** (paid backup if both fail)
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

**Free Tier Details:**
- $5 free credits (good for ~10,000 API calls with GPT-3.5-turbo)
- Credits expire after 3 months
- More than enough for resume automation!

### Option 2: Google Gemini (100% Free, No Credit Card)

We can switch back to Gemini, but we need to use the correct model name:

1. **Your existing key works:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` (already in .env)
2. **Use correct model:** Need to update code to use `gemini-pro` or `gemini-1.5-pro`
3. **No credit card required:** Completely free
4. **Rate limits:** 60 requests/minute (more than enough)

Let me know if you want me to:
- **A)** Help you set up OpenAI (recommended - better quality)
- **B)** Fix the Gemini integration (100% free but we had 404 errors)
- **C)** Try another option

## 📊 Comparison

| Provider | Cost | Quality | Setup | Rate Limit |
|----------|------|---------|-------|------------|
| **OpenAI** | $5 free credits | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Easy | 3 RPM (free tier) |
| **Gemini** | 100% Free | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Easy | 60 RPM |
| **Grok** | ❌ Requires $ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Easy | N/A |

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Use OpenAI's free tier** - $5 credit is plenty for your use case, and GPT-3.5-turbo gives excellent results for resume customization.

If you run out, we can switch to Gemini later!
